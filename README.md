# projects

In this repository, I have included a sample of my code. In this project, I created several dual-input convolutional neural networks to classify particle interactions and to predict metavariables such as particle energy. 
This code was written using Google Colab with a GPU, you can use this link to access and run the code:

Unfortunaley, GitHub can only display .ipynb files as static html.
